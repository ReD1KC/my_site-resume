I'm a Frontend developer. I specialize in building robust and scalable applications using TypeScript, React/Next.js. Since I have worked in teams many times and am familiar with the full cycle of IT product development, I actively offer my colleagues ways to discuss solutions and solve problems comprehensively.

I have experience with modern frameworks and tools such as Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, Expo, Vue.js. I have been involved in developing and maintaining network infrastructure as well as creating application architecture. My experience also includes system administration, project management within SCRUM, and AI systems development.

In my work, it is important to me that the whole team wants to make a quality and modern product. That there is feedback and opportunity for growth in this particular company.

I will be glad to work with you if you like the latest technologies as much as I do!`;
